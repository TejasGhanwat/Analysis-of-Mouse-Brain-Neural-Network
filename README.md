# Analysis-of-Mouse-Brain-Neural-Network

This project was part of the CPT_S 591 Elements of Network Science course.
My projetc partner and I decided to perform analysis of mouse brain neural netork in R. 

In this project, we used various measures to analyze the neural network which we studied in the course, 

1) Degree distribution
2) Clustering Coeﬃcient
3) K- core decomposition
4) Strength
5) Maximum ﬂow
6) Closeness centrality
7) Page Rank
8) Betweenness centrality
9) Authority and hub score
10) Modularity

Based on these measures, comparisions were made and observations were drawn. The results are discussed in detail in the report
